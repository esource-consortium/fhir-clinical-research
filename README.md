# eSource Consortium - FHIR for Clinical Research (CR Core)
## Overview

This implementation guide is based on FHIR Version 3.0.1 and defines the minimum conformance requirements necessary for exchanging clinical trial data. Typically, this exchange will be between a clinical trial site and a clinical trial sponsor.

The FHIR profiles referenced in this guide are closely aligned with the profiles as defined in [US Core](http://www.hl7.org/fhir/us/core/). 

A rendered version of this implementation guide can be found at [TODO].

[TODO]: Refactor remaining markdown files to html page fragments
